INTRO

zack climbs the beanstalk and may even return a golden harp from the sky. zack 
allows you to do RPC via beanstalkd. It will encode your messages and handle
return values. 

SYNOPSIS

  # Server
  class Server
    def answer
      puts 'answer called'
      42
    end
  end
  
  require 'zack'
  Zack::Server.new(
    'the_answer_to_life_the_universe_and_everything', 
    :simple => Server, 
    :server => 'localhost:11300'
  ).run
  
  # Client
  require 'zack'
  answer = Zack::Client.
    new(
      'the_answer_to_life_the_universe_and_everything', 
      :server => 'localhost:11300', 
      :with_answer => [:answer]).
    answer
    
  puts "The answer is #{answer}!"
  
This will output 'answer called' on the server and 'The answer is 41!' on the
client. 

zack is a small library that doesn't do much more than what has been shown
above.
